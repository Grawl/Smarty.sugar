# Smarty Sugar for Espresso

Based on the [php-smarty TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/php-smarty.tmbundle)

## Known bugs
- smarty highlighting is present inside html tags enclosed by {literal}
- custom block functions (e.g. {textformat}{/textformat}) won't show in itemizer as a parent node

## Todo
- highlighting for $smarty reserved variable and foreach/section variables (index, iteration etc.)
- auto-completion and highlighting for native variable modifiers
- mark invalid syntax?
